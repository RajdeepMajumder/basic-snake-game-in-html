# basic-snake-game-in-html
Snake is a fun game to make as it doesn't require a lot of code (less than 100 lines with all comments removed). This is a basic implementation of the snake game, but it's missing a few things intentionally and they're left as further exploration for the reader.
This is a fun project to keep yourself busy during this Pandemic Lockdown perion and you can explore the world of coding. Happy Learning everyone!!!
